# poseidon
Poseidon is an Arduino program for watering your plants. This program is indented for the Arduino nano but works with other Arduinos as well. It controls a relay that turns on and off a water pump. It also has support for 2 LEDs for status updates. A 3 position switch is required for operation.

All of the pin numbers can be adjusted in the software.
